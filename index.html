            This sketch lets users set a timed focus session, where a lightbulb is gradually getting brighter, 
            symbolizing increasing focus and productivity over time. It is designed for students or professionals wanting a 
            calm and ambient visual timer for focus or work sessions, replacing the stressful traditional countdown timer.
            I chose to use the visual of a lightbulb since it symbolizes ideas of clarity, with its gradual glow mirroring focus 
            throughout a session. As it brightens, it visually represents productivity increasing throughout a session. This makes time 
            progression much more engaging as compared to a mechanical clock. I also decided to have ambient background changes, with the
            background gradually getting brighter as time passes, reflecting the growth of light from the bulb. This visual background shift 
            helps to maintain a peaceful environment while also marking progress. I had to consider low-light visibility when the timer initially started,
            ensuring something was always visible even when the bulb was dim. Lastly, instead of having text input, I decided to include 
            simple preset options for different timers. This approach allows users to simply focus on their work, without having to worry about trying to
            figure out a complex clock design. A feature I'd like to implement for the future would be to add a soft dimming phase after
            a study session to signal break time and a chance to reset. Additionally, I think it would be cool to allow users to choose
            from various visual themes such as a candle or sunrise to make it seem more customizable according to their mood.

            Context: This sketch represents time passing through the flipping of pages in a book, symbolizing
            steady learning and progress throughout a study or reading session.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is ideal for students or readers who want a visual sense of progression rather
            than a countdown-based timer.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> For this sketch, I decided to implement the page flipping animation. Each page flipping 
            marks the passage of time, reflecting how focus sessions build knowledge with each page. The visual's goal is to display time in 
            a gradual manner to show progression. In terms of color palette, I decided to keep it fairly simple, using beige tones for paper
            and brown for the cover, creating a familiar visual that is appealing to look at. I also decided to have each page flip every minute,
            giving users a sense of rhythm and progression instead of stress or urgency.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> For the future, I think it would be unique to include page numbers as a way to show how much
            time as passed. This will give users a visual of what time they're currently on. Additionally, I think it would be cool to allow
            users to customize their chapter size for how long they'd like to work/be productive for.</li>
          </ul>

            Context: This sketch visualizes productivity and time management through a battery, where users can set
            a duration and watch the battery gradually deplete as time passes, symbolizing energy expenditure during 
            focused work sessions.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is designed for students or professionals using a Pomodoro-style focus timer,
            helping them visualize energy levels during concentrated work sessions and breaks.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> The time shapes the shape of a battery that's getting emptied over time,
            directly connecting the concept of energy with focus. This choice makes progress for intuitive, since as the battery
            drains, users see their sessions slowly ending. In terms of color choices, I decided to go for a green to red gradient.
            The gradual color shift from green to red mirror how energy or focus fades during long productive sessions. It creates
            both an aesthetic transition and a cue for users to take a break once the battery hits red. The input and start buttons
            are also intentionally designed to be simple to maintain the focus on the timer, reducing on-screen clutter and distractions
            during work sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> An idea I can implement for the future includes adding short and long break options, similar to
            what Pomodoro-style clocks have. Additionally, I think it would be nice to include motivational messages or small visual rewards after
            completing a work session. This would make the clock a lot more engaging and fun, encouraging people to continue being productive.</li>
          </ul>
